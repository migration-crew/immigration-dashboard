#### Checklist

- [ ] <span style="color:red">Did you create a component in your folder in playground folder?</span>
  - If not, Let's put it there. We're gonna combine all components later together.
- [ ] <span style="color:red">Does this PR include only 1 component?</span>
  - If not, Let's make another PR for that!
- [ ] Did you check if you can use a component from ShadCN?
  - If not, Let's try to use a component from [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion) first before making it from scratch by yourself! [v0](https://v0.dev/) can also useful if you cannot find any.
- [ ] Did you check if you can use a common component? (e.g. text components)
  - If not, Let's find a common component that you can use in the Notion!
- [ ] Did you use defined color in tailwind.config?
  - If not, Let's use a defined color NOT define your own color. If you cannot find a color, Let's discuss with team members!
